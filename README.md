# Slipway

[![Bootstrap](https://image.ibb.co/cj8yw5/powered_by_bootstrap.png)](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Slipway is an open-source landing page template built upon [Bootstrap] designed for Open-Source Projects

  - Responsive
  - Easy to edit
  - Static so you can host on [GitHub Pages] for free

# New Features!

  - Choose different color styles (normal, blue, red, orange)
  - Number Counters


Because this is an open-source project, please give ideas or even develop your own and make a push request.

### Libraries, Frameworks and Plugins  Used

Slipway uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Animate on Scroll] - A JavaScript library that adds animations on scroll
* [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [CounterUp] - lightweight jQuery plugin that counts up to a targeted number when the number becomes visible
* [jQuery] - duh
* [Popper] - A kickass library used to manage poppers in web applications
* [Smooth Scroll] - A lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor link

And of course Slipway itself is open source with a [public repository][slipway]
 on GitHub.

### Getting Started

Simply [download] the zip and after unarchiving it, just edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Just remember, you are REQUIRED to give some sort of credit to the author.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

We love help from other developers. So if you want to help, here's how.

After editing the files to your heart's content, send a push request to the "Contribution" branch. Check the issues tab for anything that may need fixing.

### Slipway
There is a [Demo] available

Slipway is a simply built template with a whole ton of features.

### To-Dos

 - Add more color options

## Help Editing Website
If you need help, ask. Create an issue and expect a response in 24 hours.

I'm more than willing to create a custom website for any open-source project that plans to help current and future developers.
